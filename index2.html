					<h2>How we started...</h2>
					<p>“The sweet ring” was created by a 15 year old girl with a dream to share her love for sweetness and creativity through her own shop. What started as a small idea grew into a colorful world full of donuts and smiles. Each treat is made with care and love, reminding everyone that even the sweetest dreams can come true.</p>
